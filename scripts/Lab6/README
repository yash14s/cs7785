# Simple, Poorly Functioning KNN Classifier. 

It will train and test each time you run the code

example_knn.py - This code runs considering the full image without any processing. The KNN classifier acts only on the raw picture pixel intensity values. The resulting model achieves around 1/4 accuracy (slightly better than random guessing, 1/4).

There are two ways to run this code:

1) With visualization of fed images:
python croppedKNN.py

2) Without visualization of fed images:
python -O croppedKNN.py

NOTE: here the -O is the capital letter not zero.
